**xnAdverts**

A simple standalone advert system for FiveM.

**Installation**

Copy xnAdverts to your resources folder and add `start xnAdverts` to your server.cfg

**Adding your own adverts**

Open the config.lua and check out how other adverts are done, it's pretty self explanatory. You can find plenty of advert sized tumbnails by searching for `char_` in Codewalker or OpenIV.
